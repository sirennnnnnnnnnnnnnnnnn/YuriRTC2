# Deployment

This guide describes a generic YuriRTC deployment. Replace every example value with your own configuration, keep server credentials outside the repository, and test the complete flow before directing users to it.

## 1. Build and verify

Use the locked JavaScript dependency graph and run both language test suites:

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build

(cd content-node && go test ./...)
```

Before a production rollout, run the real local browser-to-node path as well:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

It uses local test signaling rather than the production Firebase project, but
otherwise runs the generated carrier, service worker, loader, Chrome WebRTC,
the Go content handler, multi-frame downloads, streaming API uploads, and a
two-tab carrier/standby election while one upload remains in flight.

Install and exercise all supported browser engines before a loader or node
rollout. The Go harness runs every selected engine over forced UDP and TCP:

```bash
node node_modules/playwright-core/cli.js install chromium firefox webkit

YURIRTC_BROWSER_E2E_ENGINES=chromium,firefox,webkit \
YURIRTC_BROWSER_E2E_PROTOCOLS=udp,tcp \
npm run test:e2e
```

For a focused failure, set `YURIRTC_BROWSER_E2E_ENGINES` to one of `chromium`,
`firefox`, or `webkit`, and `YURIRTC_BROWSER_E2E_PROTOCOLS` to `udp` or `tcp`.
`npm run ci:local` selects all three engines and both protocols by default. It
does not invoke the release script, publish npm packages, upload a carrier, or
modify `deploy/npm/deployments`.

The ordinary build may use placeholder browser configuration and is suitable for source validation only. Build and verify deployable artifacts after choosing the Firebase client configuration in step 4.

## 2. Configure Firebase

Create a Firebase project for the deployment, then enable:

- Cloud Firestore in Native mode;
- Realtime Database;
- the authentication provider required by the RTDB signaling leg, normally anonymous authentication.

The generic configuration is under `deploy/firebase`:

```text
firebase.json
firestore.rules
firestore.indexes.json
database.rules.json
```

Deploy it explicitly to the intended project:

```bash
(
  cd deploy/firebase
  firebase deploy \
    --project "example-project" \
    --only database,firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
)
```

The Firestore index template enables TTL for signaling records. Confirm the TTL policy is active after deployment; TTL deletion is asynchronous, so the content node also removes completed/stale records.

Verify the rules against a non-production project before launch:

```bash
FB_API_KEY="example-public-web-key" \
FB_PROJECT="example-project" \
FB_DB_URL="https://example-project-default-rtdb.example-region.firebasedatabase.app" \
node deploy/firebase/tools/verify-rules.mjs
```

The web API key and client project identifiers are public configuration. Restrict the key to the required Firebase APIs and expected web origins where the provider supports it. Never use a service-account key in browser configuration.

Create a least-privilege server identity that can observe and answer the signaling records. Prefer workload identity or the platform's Application Default Credentials. If a JSON credential file is unavoidable, store it outside the checkout and make it readable only by the content-node account.

## 3. Build the content node

```bash
mkdir -p build
(cd content-node && go build -trimpath -o ../build/yurirtc-content-node .)
```

Build from the complete checkout: the local Pion SCTP, DTLS, and transport
replacements are required. For optional offline gzip sidecars and rotating
certificate behavior, see [CPU-efficient delivery](CACHE-AND-CDNS.md#cpu-efficient-delivery-and-offline-compression).

Configure it with YuriRTC environment names:

```ini
YURIRTC_PUBLIC_IP=203.0.113.10
YURIRTC_BIND_IP=203.0.113.10
YURIRTC_PORTS=443,80,5228,5229,5230,5223,2197,53,123,49152,445
YURIRTC_ROOT=/var/lib/yurirtc/site
YURIRTC_BACKEND=http://127.0.0.1:1801
YURIRTC_SCTP_CONGESTION_CONTROL=cubic
YURIRTC_PROJECT=example-project
YURIRTC_DATABASE_URL=https://example-project-default-rtdb.example-region.firebasedatabase.app
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/yurirtc/service-account.json
```

`203.0.113.10` is a documentation-only address. `YURIRTC_DATABASE_URL` must be copied from the Firebase console; do not construct it from the project name because RTDB host formats vary.

The default port set opens each listed port over both UDP and TCP, and ICE uses whichever pair reaches the visitor. List ports least to most likely to be filtered: every host candidate on one address carries the same ICE priority whatever its port, so the order is what decides which the browser tries first, and it paces parallel checks rather than sequencing fallbacks. Change the set when a port is already owned on the selected bind address; binding is all-or-nothing, so one conflict stops the node from starting. A common deployment gives the content node its own address so low ports do not conflict with a conventional web server. Each port costs two listening sockets and four more candidates in every offer, and the host firewall must permit each one over both protocols.

Generic Linux examples are provided in `deploy/systemd/content-node.service`, `deploy/systemd/node.env.example`, and `deploy/sysctl/90-yurirtc-content-node.conf`. Review all paths, identities, limits, ports, and kernel settings for the target host before installing them; they are templates rather than an unattended installer.

Run the process as a dedicated unprivileged account. If it binds ports below 1024, grant only the operating-system capability required to bind low ports instead of running the whole service as root. Limit the firewall to the selected UDP/TCP ports and administrative access from trusted networks. The optional API backend should normally remain on loopback or a private network.

Configuration uses the `YURIRTC_*` names; see [Compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md).

YuriRTC advertises direct ICE candidates only. Do not add TURN credentials or assume a TURN listener exists.

`YURIRTC_SCTP_CONGESTION_CONTROL` defaults to `cubic`. Set it to `reno` only as
a deliberate runtime rollback; any other value stops startup. CUBIC applies at
the sender and remains interoperable with unmodified browser SCTP receivers.
The once-per-minute `health` log reports aggregate UDP/TCP counts, interval
SCTP throughput, CWND/RWND limitation counts, window/RTT/MTU percentiles, and
allocation/GC rates. It never logs candidates, addresses, URLs, or peer IDs.

The node can be deployed before the corresponding loader without changing the
protocol-v3 wire version. An older loader does not send the private gzip or
route-probe headers and therefore continues to receive ordinary static bytes
over ordinary ICE. Deploy and canary this node-first state before publishing a
loader that opts into the new behavior.

For capable loaders, complete compressible static GET responses of at least
1 KiB may use the private
`x-yurirtc-accept-wire-encoding: gzip` /
`x-yurirtc-wire-encoding: gzip` negotiation. This is not HTTP
`Content-Encoding`; the loader decompresses it before exposing the response.
Ranges, APIs, SSE, non-compressible media, and `no-transform` requests are not
wire-compressed. The process keeps a bounded 64 MiB compressed LRU, retains at
most 8 MiB per entry, coalesces duplicate builds, and streams assets above the
cacheable source limit rather than retaining them.

All static 200/206/304 responses include consistent validators and revalidation
metadata. Non-hashed files use `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`; `/a/`
retains its one-year immutable policy. This lets arbitrary hosted sites reuse
unchanged browser-cached bodies through a bodyless 304 without treating unknown
paths as immutable. API, authenticated, partial, streaming, private, and
`no-store` responses remain outside the universal cache.

## 4. Build the static carriers

The static shell needs public Firebase web configuration at release-build time:

```bash
export YURIRTC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="example-public-web-key"
export YURIRTC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="example-project"
export YURIRTC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="https://example-project-default-rtdb.example-region.firebasedatabase.app"

npm run build:release

npm run verify:release
```

Keep the selected values in the environment through npm publication because the static carrier's prepack hook rebuilds and revalidates the release.

`verify:release` fails if an npm tarball includes source maps, readable compiled JavaScript, compiled tests, or an unexpected file. It verifies loader exports, the signed pointer, client SHA-256, immutable CDN URLs, carrier fingerprints, and the version-pinned worker stub.

The outputs are:

```text
deploy/npm/index.html
deploy/npm/sw.js
deploy/npm/bundled/index.html
deploy/npm/bundled/sw.js
deploy/npm/bundled/client.js
deploy/npm/bundled/LICENSE
deploy/npm/bundled/FONT-LICENSE.txt
deploy/npm/bundled/SOURCE.txt
```

The carrier embeds the manifest public key and the two `shaintloadingcheckpak@latest/loader.json` CDN locations. The private signing key never enters carrier output. A verified pointer selects immutable `@advwebrec/grainloading@VERSION` client, font, and worker paths. The build does not compile a bucket name or path prefix.

The `bundled/` variant is for networks that cannot reach jsDelivr or unpkg. Its
HTML embeds the exact loader client and font built from this checkout, its
`sw.js` is the full same-version worker, and `client.js` is the durable
same-origin recovery source persisted for transported pages. It is pinned at
build time and must be rebuilt for a new loader version. Upload all six files
together; the three notices cover the bundled AGPL loader and OFL font.

Do not edit generated files. Do not publish or upload the readable source templates in their place.

## 5. Publish the loader and signed pointer

Use a new loader version for every byte change; npm versions are immutable.
After a production content node compatible with the loader being released is
deployed and its wire canary is healthy, run the guarded release workflow with
the Firebase variables from step 4 still exported. A same-wire loader release
is compatible with the deployed node. A wire change must deploy and canary a
backward-compatible transition node before publishing its loader:

```bash
YURIRTC_CONTENT_NODE_CANARY_OK=1 ./deploy/release.sh
```

The script runs the complete local CI gate, authenticates each npm account with
its separate staging credential, and invokes a pinned npm CLI version that
supports staged publishing (npm 11.15 or newer, on Node.js 22.14 or newer). It
never performs a direct, unattended `npm publish`. Complete the resumable
release with the same guarded command on every pass:

1. The first pass stages `@advwebrec/grainloading` and stops. Review and approve
   the staged loader on the npmjs.com website with the required human 2FA
   challenge.
2. Run the command again. It recognizes the published loader, verifies its
   registry tarball and all five immutable CDN copies, regenerates and verifies the
   signed pointer, stages `shaintloadingcheckpak`, and stops. Review and approve
   that stage on the npmjs.com website with 2FA. The published pointer retains
   the legacy two-URL signed format; upgraded carriers derive all five runtime
   URLs from its authenticated version and hash, so older npm carriers keep working.
3. Run the command a final time. It recognizes both published versions,
   verifies the signed pointer's registry and CDN bytes, and completes.

Rerunning after an interruption is safe: the script resumes the expected
already-staged or already-published version and refuses inconsistent published
versions or `latest` tags. It never publishes `learnmathedu` or any carrier
package and never rebuilds a deployment directory.

npm's [Dual-Use Content Policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/dual-use/)
requires declared dual-use packages to use interactive 2FA at direct publish or
human 2FA when a staged release is approved. The
[official staged publishing guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing/)
also makes clear that a bypass-capable token can submit a stage but cannot
bypass its approval challenge. Use staging credentials with the required
package/scope access; do not use direct bypass-token publication.

Keep `NPM_LOADER_TOKEN`, `NPM_INTEGRITY_TOKEN`, and `YURIRTC_MANIFEST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` in the git-ignored `.env.release`. The repository-owned `deploy/npmrc.publish` contains only an environment-variable reference and no credential.

## 6. Upload to static hosting

Upload both files to the same directory. Required metadata:

| File | Content-Type | Cache-Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index.html` | `text/html; charset=utf-8` | `no-cache` |
| `sw.js` | `text/javascript; charset=utf-8` | `no-cache` |

Example GCS upload to a directory-shaped object prefix:

```bash
gsutil -h "Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8" \
  -h "Cache-Control:no-cache" \
  cp deploy/npm/index.html gs://example-bucket/releases/stable/index.html

gsutil -h "Content-Type:text/javascript; charset=utf-8" \
  -h "Cache-Control:no-cache" \
  cp deploy/npm/sw.js gs://example-bucket/releases/stable/sw.js
```

Example S3 upload:

```bash
aws s3 cp deploy/npm/index.html \
  s3://example-bucket/releases/stable/index.html \
  --content-type "text/html; charset=utf-8" \
  --cache-control "no-cache"

aws s3 cp deploy/npm/sw.js \
  s3://example-bucket/releases/stable/sw.js \
  --content-type "text/javascript; charset=utf-8" \
  --cache-control "no-cache"
```

Make the two objects readable through the intended distribution policy. Link users to the exact object:

```text
https://storage.googleapis.com/example-bucket/releases/stable/index.html
https://s3.example-region.amazonaws.com/example-bucket/releases/stable/index.html
```

Do not assume the directory URL will resolve to `index.html`; REST object endpoints often return a listing, redirect, XML error, or access denial instead.

The service worker can normally control only its own directory. Keep `sw.js` beside `index.html` and allow the shell to derive the directory scope. Do not force `/` scope on a path-style deployment unless the hosting response deliberately grants it with `Service-Worker-Allowed`.

## 7. End-to-end validation

Test with a clean browser profile and with an upgraded profile that already has the previous worker installed.

Confirm:

1. `index.html` and `sw.js` return 200 with the expected content types and cache policy.
2. The service-worker script URL is the sibling of the current page and its scope ends at the containing directory.
3. The page reloads at most once to establish synthesized cross-origin isolation headers.
4. Firestore or RTDB signaling produces an answer and the RTC data channel opens.
5. A first session can complete the bounded 1 MiB auto/TCP route comparison, while an older-node control cleanly keeps ordinary ICE when the exact private marker is absent.
6. The censorship indicator reports the selected coarse UDP/TCP and standard/443 route class without rendering or logging a candidate, address, or exact non-443 port.
7. A compressible static response is decoded to its exact original bytes in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit; Range and API responses remain unencoded.
8. A generic static file returns validators, is retained only within the configured cache budget, and answers an unchanged repeat with 304 plus the cached body; changed, private, ranged, and no-store controls are not reused incorrectly.
9. During a slow-UDP handoff, new requests move to the warmed TCP route while an existing download or WebSocket completes on UDP; a failed TCP warm-up leaves UDP working and no mutation is replayed.
10. Scripts, styles, fonts, and other small critical files remain responsive while WASM, archives, media, and game payloads occupy the incremental lanes.
11. The application frame loads, signs in, makes API calls, opens chat/event streams, and loads static assets.
12. Navigation, Back, Forward, refresh, forms, programmatic fetch/XHR, dynamic image/script URLs, and application history stay inside the virtual deployment root.
13. No same-origin application request reaches an object-store root and returns an XML error page.
14. Blocking each loader CDN independently still permits the next configured source to load (UNPKG, jsDelivr, esm.sh raw, unpkg.toolforge.org, then s4.zstatic.net).
15. Visible loader copy renders correctly through the versioned font without a plaintext/ciphertext flash.
16. A forced transport loss shows the disconnected view, retries with bounded jitter, and restores only the contained application; blocking every route shows the unavailable view and its manual retry remains functional.

Test both an origin-root URL and at least one nested or path-style URL. Keep browser network logs sanitized when attaching them to an issue.

After npm and the content node are live, the production canary serves the
verified local carrier on loopback but deliberately uses its embedded public
Firebase configuration, the real npm CDNs, and the production RTC node:

```bash
npm run test:prod-canary
YURIRTC_CANARY_PROTOCOL=udp npm run test:prod-canary
YURIRTC_CANARY_PROTOCOL=tcp npm run test:prod-canary
```

It prints only coarse counts and states; it does not print Firebase query
parameters, signaling capabilities, API keys, or application URLs. The optional
protocol setting filters the production node's answer inside Chrome and verifies
that the reported coarse route uses the requested transport. During a wire
transition, run the default and both forced routes before retiring the
transition node and again after the final single-version restart.

## 8. Capacity validation

The repository includes an opt-in capacity harness in the content-node tests. Its `YURIRTC_CAPACITY_*` variables control a generator and measurement server.

Run capacity tests only in an isolated environment with explicit resource and traffic limits. A concurrency result applies to the tested CPU, memory, file-descriptor limits, kernel buffers, network, signaling quota, candidate protocol, application response mix, and session duration. YuriRTC does not claim a universal maximum-user figure from a short synthetic run.

For sustained-transfer regressions, install `iproute2` on a Linux host with
user/network namespaces enabled and run:

```bash
./content-node/wan-regression.sh --quick
./content-node/wan-regression.sh --full
```

Each benchmark creates a private network namespace and applies `tc netem` only
to its loopback device. It drives the real request handler, response-credit
path, WebRTC, DTLS, and SCTP stack over forced UDP or TCP. Override the fixture
size from its 64 MiB sustained-transfer default with `YURIRTC_WAN_BENCH_MIB`
in the supported 8..1024 MiB range.
For controller comparisons outside the fixed regression script, set
`YURIRTC_BENCH_SCTP_CC=reno` on a direct `go test -bench` invocation; an unset
value exercises the production CUBIC default.

## 9. Release ordering and rollback

For the current same-wire performance release, deploy and canary the updated
content node first. Existing loaders continue using uncompressed protocol-v3
responses and ordinary ICE. Only after old-loader traffic, node health, the
three-engine UDP/TCP E2E matrix, cache validators, compression, and route
handoff pass should an immutable loader and its signed pointer be published.
No carrier needs rebuilding or uploading unless its own static bytes changed.

A wire-version transition uses this order:

1. Deploy the backward-compatible transition content node and verify its service health.
2. Deploy and verify Firebase rules/indexes.
3. Publish the loader that speaks the new wire.
4. Confirm all five runtime CDNs serve that immutable version, then publish the signed pointer package.
5. Upload `index.html` and `sw.js` together.
6. Complete clean-profile and upgrade-profile validation.
7. Run the real Firebase/CDN production canary.
8. Deploy the final single-version content node and repeat its health, wire, and production canaries.

`deploy/release.sh` enforces the local clean-profile and upgrade-profile browser
gates and refuses npm publication unless
`YURIRTC_CONTENT_NODE_CANARY_OK=1` is set. Set that flag only after a production
node compatible with the candidate loader has passed its health and matching
wire canaries. A deployed same-wire node satisfies that gate for same-wire
loader releases; a protocol change requires its transition node first. The
script then stages the loader and pauses for npmjs.com website 2FA approval. Reusing
the same guarded command after approval verifies all five immutable CDN copies,
stages the pointer, and pauses for its own website 2FA approval; a final rerun
verifies the published pointer and completes. It does not publish a carrier.

A single-version node rejects every older wire version. To roll a wire change
back, first restore and verify the transition node, then publish a new signed
pointer version naming the previous immutable loader. Restore the previous
generated pair together only if shell bytes also changed. Keep transition-node
backups until the rollback window is formally closed.
