 *    Every hit is optional and every write can fail mid-flight.
 * 2. Eviction is origin-atomic — Chrome drops Cache API, IndexedDB, and OPFS
 *    together — so exceeding quota does not just cost us the cache, it takes the
 *    service-worker session with it. We self-evict well below the ceiling to stay away from

 * bandwidth, those invisible reads can occupy every bulk lane. This wrapper
 * has a zero-sized queue and performs exactly one upstream read for each

 * only a clean EOF stores them. Cancellation or request abort is propagated to
 * the original body and drops the partial copy.
