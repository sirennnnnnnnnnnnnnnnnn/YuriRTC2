 * The proxy engine's half of the service worker, and the shim that gives it
 * first refusal on the requests it owns.
 *
 * Under the static deployment this worker is the only worker a page has: the
 * shell registers it, and the guard turns the site's own registration into a
 * no-op that hands back this one. A site that proxies therefore cannot install
 * its request handling separately -- so it travels here, exactly as it travels
 * inside the site's combined worker on every other deployment.
 *
 * Order and stopImmediatePropagation are both load-bearing. The loader's own
 * fetch handler answers every same-origin request that is not one of its static
 * assets, and a second respondWith on one event throws. Registering the
 * engine's listener first lets it claim proxied requests, and stopping
 * propagation keeps the loader from ever seeing them.
 *
 * It claims the proxied prefix on its own rather than waiting to be told which
 * prefix it owns. Being told is still preferred, but that answer only exists
 * while a tab has registered: a worker the browser restarted to deliver a
 * request has no tabs yet, and a section that stayed inert until told would
 * decline that request and let it reach the carrier. Not obfuscated again: it
 * arrives already built, and the engine's injected half looks its own globals
 * up by name.
